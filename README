shellCore.

this is the very BASIC core of miyoko/shellIRC.

this includes the very basics for a simple, working bot:
  /shellbot.sh
  /include/libparser.sh
  /include/libchannel.sh
  /include/libchat.sh
  /include/libctcp.sh
  /etc/core_input
  /etc/core_config.sh

(referring relatively to /)

config is very much the same, much functionality was removed to 
create a bare-bones fork of this bot. plus a ^raw trigger was added
so the end-user could execute irc commands (ex., identify, different 
commands), so this bot should be great if you want a bare-bones and
minimal bot.
